# Van Kiosk
This is the code repository for an ongoing project to develop a kiosk display using a raspberry pi for a van. Currently it displays weather, time, location, tilt and butane / water levels (this is ongoing). The code in this repository is used in a pi image with cron jobs set to run the various scripts to gather the data neccessary. When closer to complete, the image file for the pi itself will be made available
